# AgileFlow – Agile Sprint Symphony

**AgileFlow** is a lightweight Agile project management platform developed as part of my final year BSc Computer Science thesis.  
It enables small teams to manage sprints, assign tasks, and visualise progress using Agile principles, all in a clean, real-time collaborative interface.

## 📦 Installation

To run the project locally:

git clone https://github.com/1Kelv/agile-sprint-symphony
cd agile-sprint-symphony
npm install
npm run dev


🤖 Machine Learning Integration
AgileFlow includes an experimental in-browser sprint prediction feature using TensorFlow.js.
It estimates sprint success likelihood based on velocity and task completion trends, a step toward AI-assisted Agile planning.

📌 Disclaimer
This project was developed independently as part of my undergraduate thesis.
While I used tools like Supabase for infrastructure, all UI logic, styling, integration, and testing were manually implemented and documented by me.
