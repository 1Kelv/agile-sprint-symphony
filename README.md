# AgileFlow – Agile Sprint Symphony

AgileFlow is a lightweight Agile project management platform developed as part of my final year undergraduate thesis. It helps small teams manage sprints, assign tasks, and visualise progress using Agile principles. The application was built with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and real-time collaboration.

## 📦 Installation

To run the project locally:


git clone https://github.com/1Kelv/agile-sprint-symphony
cd agile-sprint-symphony
npm install
npm run dev


🤖 Machine Learning Integration
The project includes an early-stage sprint prediction feature using TensorFlow.js, which runs in-browser. It estimates the likelihood of sprint success based on task completion data and velocity.

📌 Disclaimer
This project was developed independently as part of my Computer Science final year project. While I used tools like Supabase to accelerate development, all logic, components, styling, and integrations were implemented and tested manually.
